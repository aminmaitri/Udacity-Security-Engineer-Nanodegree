1] create a new user and set apassword for the user:

useradd apache-user
passwd apachce-user

2]create new group called "apache-group"

groupadd apache-group

3]Moving the user to a new group

usermod -g apache-group apache-user

4]In order to deny the apache-user user access to the su command, I modified the /etc/sudoers file by adding this line to the end of the file:

sudo gedit /etc/sudoers

apache-user  ALL=(ALL) ALL,!/bin/su
